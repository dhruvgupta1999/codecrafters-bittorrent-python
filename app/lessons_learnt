1.
Writing readable code for this is actual hardwork.
I don't even want to look at my implementation for decoding the bencoded string.

2.
Unit tests helped modify my code to keep it correct in face of changing requirements.

3.
Changing requirements was a serious problem.
Like didn't expect list also to be there, only simple int and str.

Then I didn't expect that bytes datatype can have characters which are not supported in utf8.
So I had to change my decode_bencoded_string() implementation to use purely bytes.

So plan ahead if at all possible.
Complain less when you see crappy code at office.
Changing requirements and limited time can do that to you.
Just write good enough unit tests so you know it works.
Refactor if you have the time.
